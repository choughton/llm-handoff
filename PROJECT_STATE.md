# Project State

This file is the durable state pointer for `llm-handoff`, which develops itself
through its own dispatch loop. Keep it short. Detailed implementation notes
belong in commits, handoffs, and pull requests.

It holds current work only. Closed epics, their ledger lines, and older
status notes are in `COMPLETED_WORK.md`; read that file only when you need
history.

## Current Status

- **Active Epic:** ESCALATION-RECONCILE (epic 16), picked by fit after
  ACTIVE-PLANNER (epic 18) closed at `d33abfd` and merged in PR #293
  (`0b18d66`): small, independent, and unblocked. RECON-1 (config and
  first-cycle pass) was approved at `9100a57` and merged in PR #294
  (`8f5d698`). RECON-2 (later cycles and the no-loop guard), the last story,
  is implemented and in review.
- **Parked Epic:** None.
- **Other Open Epics:** WORK-INTAKE (epic 14, INTAKE-1 through INTAKE-3)
  waits on its pre-INTAKE-1 user design check, taken once no open epic has
  an unblocked story.
- **Epic Awaiting Close:** None.
- **Current Blocker:** None.
- **Active Branch:** main (story branches `llm-handoff/*`, one pull request per
  story).

## Backlog

The planner chooses the next epic by fit, not by position in this list.
Numbers are labels, not priorities. When the active epic closes, or when its
next story waits on something outside the loop, the planner reads every open
epic's intro and `Fit:` line and picks the one whose first story is unblocked,
whose dependencies are closed, and whose result the loop needs soonest. A
story that unblocks a parked epic, fixes what the last run broke, or changes
the planner's own protocol goes before a feature; a cheap story that fills a
wait goes before a long one that would hold it. The planner states the choice
and the reason in the handoff `reason`, and has the next Work Packet record it
in Current Status.

Parking. An epic whose next story waits on the operator (a live check, a
decision, a merge) is parked, not closed. Instead of routing to `user` and
pausing the loop, the planner picks another epic and has that epic's first
Work Packet record the parked epic in Current Status: its name, its remaining
stories, and the exact operator action it waits for, so the ask survives the
next handoff rewrite. One epic is active at a time. The planner returns to a
parked epic when the operator reports the blocker cleared, in this file or at
the operator prompt. Route to `user` only when no open epic has an unblocked
story.

Each story is one Work Packet; the role that assigns it writes its Files in
scope, Verification command, and acceptance criteria from the code. With a
tpm configured, that is the tpm; without one, it is the planner. Add, drop,
or re-shape epics by editing this list; that stays with the planner, which
also writes each epic's intro, `Fit:` line, and story outline.

Story size and IDs (operator rule, 2026-10-19). With a tpm configured, the
tpm sizes, splits, and renumbers the stories inside the open epic under these
rules; without one, the planner does. A story is one behavior
change: about four source modules or fewer plus their tests and docs, one
verification focus, and one role. A story that would edit `.claude/` does
not mix that edit with code: Claude roles cannot write `.claude/`, so those
edits go in one operator story that routes to `user`, at the end of the
epic unless a later story needs those files first.
Story IDs are flat: `EPIC-N` only. When a story turns out too large, replace
it with new stories numbered after the epic's highest number and add
`(was EPIC-3)` to each; never use letter or nested suffixes such as `3a` or
`3b1`. Merged stories keep their IDs. Stories not started yet may be
renumbered in execution order.

Closed epics, with their full intros and story lists, are in
`COMPLETED_WORK.md`; the open epics below keep their numbers.

### 14. WORK-INTAKE - turn a plain request into epics and stories

Fit: needs a user design check before INTAKE-1. INTAKE-2 rewrites how the
planner turns a request into this file's epics, so take TPM-ROLE first and
write the intake rules once for the planner/tpm split.

Before scoping INTAKE-1, route to `user` for a short design check.

- INTAKE-1: A command that takes a plain-language request ("build me a web page
  about puppies") when no work is queued, writes it into `HANDOFF.md` as a
  request, and routes to `planner`. Refuse while an assignment is active or
  `.dispatch.lock` exists.
- INTAKE-2: Planner intake rules: architect the request, break it into epics
  and stories, add them to this file's Backlog (vanilla mode), then start the
  first story. Users never write Work Packets by hand.
- INTAKE-3: In Linear mode, the planner creates the epics and stories as Linear
  issues instead (after LINEAR-WORKFLOW).

### 16. ESCALATION-RECONCILE - a stale user escalation gets one planner pass

Fit: small (two stories) and independent. Pick it right after a run has
paused on a user escalation that turned out to be stale.

A `next_agent: user` handoff can be stale by the time a run starts: the
operator may have answered the question in a commit, merged the blocking pull
request, or edited `PROJECT_STATE.md` without touching the handoff. The source
project gives such a handoff one planner reconciliation pass before pausing.
Here the loop pauses at once (`llm_handoff/orchestrator.py` ~line 857) and
`pause_recovery` is defined as covering every pause except `next_agent: user`.
Add the pass as an explicit, bounded opt-in. It never loops: a planner that
confirms the blocker rewrites the handoff to `user` and the run pauses
normally with no second pass.

- RECON-1: Config and first-cycle pass. New top-level
  `reconcile_user_escalations: false` (the source project defaults to on;
  this reference pauses by default, so the operator turns it on). When on,
  the first cycle of a run that reads `next_agent: user` with
  `status: escalate_to_user` or `blocked_missing_context` from a producer
  other than `planner` dispatches the planner once with an instruction that
  names the pause reason, says the handoff may be stale, asks it to check the
  handoff against `PROJECT_STATE.md`, Git state, and open pull requests, and
  tells it to rewrite to `user` with the same question when the blocker
  still holds, or to the next role when it does not. The dispatch reuses the
  bounded-recovery path (`_schedule_pause_recovery`), counts in telemetry as
  `user_escalation_reconciliations`, and logs `Reconciling a user escalation
  from <producer> before pausing`. `--dry-run` prints the decision and
  dispatches nothing. A planner-produced user route on the first cycle pauses
  as today.
- RECON-2: Later cycles and the no-loop guard. On later cycles only a
  non-planner producer's user route gets the pass, once per handoff SHA. A
  user route the planner wrote during the pass, or any planner-produced user
  route, pauses with no further pass in the same run; the pause reason says
  `reconciled by planner`. In Linear mode the planner's instruction adds:
  when advancing from a leased issue whose latest evidence comment is
  `user_attention_requested`, post `user_attention_cleared` first; when
  reconfirming, post nothing. `CONFIGURATION.md` documents the key,
  `docs/handoff/PLANNER_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` documents the pass, and the
  handbook's escalation section says a user escalation may be reconciled once
  when the key is on.

Planner decision (RECON-1). `user_escalation_reconciliations` is a run-local
counter in `_run_loop_cycles`, reported only as a dispatcher log line
(`user_escalation_reconciliations=<n>`) on a live reconciliation dispatch; no
telemetry module or persistence file. A dry run neither counts nor logs it.
The pass is built with `_schedule_pause_recovery` (extended with optional
arguments) and applied in the current cycle, not scheduled for the next one:
the cycle routes to `planner` with source `user_escalation_reconciliation`,
and a live run marks pause recovery and the operator prompt's planner attempt
as used.

## Open Followups

Promoted to HARDENING stories and removed below: AUDIT-COST (a),
PAUSE-RECOVERY (c) and (d), CONFIG-CLEANUP (b), and LINEAR-FOUNDATIONS (d).
AUDIT-COST (b) and (c) closed by GEM-4b. On 2026-10-19 every other open item
was promoted to epic 19 (TIDY) except the operator check and the two design
notes below; the remaining letters are unchanged.

- From the LINEAR-FOUNDATIONS close (low, LIN-6b), an operator action:
  - (b) the probe's isolation (`llm_handoff/doctor.py`,
    `_TRACKER_PROBE_SETTINGS` ~line 1490) has not been checked against a live
    Claude CLI; an operator should run
    `llm-handoff doctor --probe-tracker <ISSUE>` once in a repo with a project
    hook and confirm the hook does not fire.

- From the source-dispatcher comparison (2026-10-18, info), design notes:
  - (c) Design choice, not a gap: the source project removed the Work Packet
    from the handoff and keeps the issue body in Linear only. This repo keeps
    the Work Packet in `HANDOFF.md` because the work-claim gate, scanners,
    protected paths, and dispatcher commit mode parse it; revisit only if a
    thin-lease mode is wanted for Linear repositories.
  - (d) Design choice, not a gap: the source project routes on a three-level
    hierarchy (initiative, project, issue) with project-open and project-close
    gates. This repo has epic and story in `remaining_stories` plus this file;
    the TPM-ROLE epic scopes the picker to one epic for that reason.

- From the ACTIVE-6 audit (medium, security, non-blocking): an implementer's
  `Environment refusal` bullet quotes the refusal text, which can carry
  credentials or sensitive command arguments into `HANDOFF.md`. The ACTIVE-7
  audit widened the scope: the planner instructions and handbook copies
  (`docs/handoff/HANDBOOK.md`, `docs/handoff/PLANNER_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md`,
  their `examples/reference-workflow/` copies, and the planner helpers) also
  ask agents to quote that refusal text. A future bounded change must
  require redaction in the implementer prompts, the planner instructions,
  the handbook, and their helper and template copies, while keeping the
  refusal category and a sanitized diagnostic. Not yet scheduled; no epic is
  opened for it here.

## Notes

- `docs/handoff/HANDOFF.md` is the live state file and stays uncommitted in
  this repository; the committed copy is the public template.
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` is the durable status file and holds current work only.
  On each epic close the finalizer moves the closed epic and its status notes
  to `COMPLETED_WORK.md`, appends its ledger line there, and advances Active
  Epic here.
- Git history is the durable record of completed work.
